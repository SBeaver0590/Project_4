# Project_4
 

 ### Description
My project is a browser based, word-guessing game. In my game the words you are trying to guess match a hidden phrase.
The player guesses those letters using an onscreen keyboard.

I created two methods:
 -Game Class
 -Phrase Class


### How Solved

I created phrases that I passed into an empty array, randomized those phrases, allowed the user to make guesses and lose
lives based of a right or wrong response, and reset the game if the user won or lost.



### Extra Credit Features

I added a background to my page and attempted to allow the user to have keyboard interactivity.
